# Illuminated Spirits

Illuminated Spirits is my first 3D game (and second Godot game). It is meant as a learning exercise to get me used to the engine. Because of that, I'm focusing more on getting all the basics of a game rather than getting them right.

I've chosen a souls-like for the genre because of the absurd lack of Elden Ring knock-offs. I am aware that souls-like is one of (if not the) hardest types of games to develop, but Pong felt overused (I've done it twice already).

## Story

The year is 1556, Florence, Italy. The main character sits down at a tavern to get a drink after a hard day of work. But the bartender, unfortunately, mishears beer as "mushroom burst trip drink" which sends him down a hallucinogenic madness (which just happens to look just like standard medieval fantasy to save me time).

## Gameplay

Absolute Sadness. You must see it with your very eyes to believe it. It is believed that a standard human brain cannot and will not comprehend the extreme levels of dire emanated by a computer running this game.

## Controls (up until now)

- WASD / Arrow Keys / Gamepad left stick -- Move the character
- Left click / E / Gamepad RT -- Attack
- Spacebar / Gamepad X -- Roll
